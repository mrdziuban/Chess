HumanPlayer class should have a color as an attribute
Each player is assigned a color in Game class
HumanPlayer is only allowed to move pieces that share its color
  HumanPlayer.color == piece.color
HumanPlayer cannot put its own king in check
  After making a move, see if check?[1] == HumanPlayer.color
  If so, make them change their move (forfeit move?)

Add play (or whatever name) method to loop until check_mate?
